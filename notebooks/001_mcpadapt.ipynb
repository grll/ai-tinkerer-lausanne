      "METHODS: We performed the world's largest randomised double-blind \n",
      "placebo-controlled intervention study (214 participants) on the efficacy of a \n",
      "food for special medical purposes (FSMP) against veisalgia symptoms. We analysed \n",
      "the effectiveness of: (1) an FSMP, including distinct plant extracts, vitamins \n",
      "and minerals, and additional (antioxidative) compounds; (2) a dietary supplement \n",
      "only comprising vitamins and minerals and additional (antioxidative) compounds; \n",
      "and (3) a placebo containing only glucose. The study followed the CONSORT \n",
      "(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines and trial registration \n",
      "was not necessary.\n",
      "RESULTS: Our study showed no statistically significant relationship between the \n",
      "variation of body water content and alcohol consumption. Contrary to common \n",
      "belief, the results showed that intervention with a supplement containing \n",
      "vitamins and minerals and additional antioxidative compounds did not lead to a \n",
      "statistically significant improvement in hangover symptoms. Additionally, our \n",
      "results confirmed a high individual variability in developing hangover symptoms \n",

      "DESIGN: Adults (18-64 y) with chronic primary insomnia (DSM-IV) were randomly \n",
      "assigned to one of four sequences of 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg of doxepin, and \n",
      "placebo in a crossover study. Treatment periods consisted of 2 polysomnographic \n",

      "Efficacy was assessed using polysomnography (PSG) and patient-reported measures. \n",
      "Safety analyses included measures of residual sedation and adverse events.\n",
      "MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were randomized. Wake time during \n",
      "sleep, the a priori defined primary endpoint, was statistically significantly \n",
      "improved at the doxepin 3 mg and 6 mg doses versus placebo. All three doses had \n",

      "final third-of-the-night also demonstrated statistically significant improvement \n",
